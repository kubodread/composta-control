# **App Name**: Compost Controller

## Core Features:

- User Profiles: User authentication and profile management to securely store and manage individual compost pile profiles.
- Compost Data Logging: Log and track data (temperature, moisture, ph) related to multiple compost piles. Users can record, review, and adjust their methods based on data, but the app uses simple logic (instead of AI) to recommend adjustments.
- Intelligent Phase Prediction: AI compost phase prediction: Based on data trends from similar, successful composts, estimate how much longer until the compost is ready. An AI tool recommends user actions for the given phase.
- CSV Data Import: Import compost data from existing CSV file. Support a variety of date formats.
- Visual Compost Tracking: Image gallery to visually track compost progress over time. Allow upload and deletion of images for each compost profile.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#6A994E) to reflect the natural composting process.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral and clean backdrop to improve content visibility.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#D77A61) used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Use clear and readable sans-serif fonts for form labels and data displays.
- Consistent use of line icons representing compost elements and actions.
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation between multiple compost profiles.
